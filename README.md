# front_end_angular
The Boots on the Ground project

This repo contains Angular code for the front end of the Boots on the Ground project.


### Demo Script
Hocho gave @xander (discord) a script for the demo we need to make with Anguar+BabyAPI.

reminder @xander please copy it here (if not copied by 3/23, 10PM Eastern Time, ask Hocho to provide).

Short version.

User makes account. Gets matched to a cluster. Then disbands the cluster. And makes another cluster. Showing off that they nearly instantaneously (with a refresh) update on the screen.

Note: BabyAPI is not firebase, so it won't do instant sync across devices.
